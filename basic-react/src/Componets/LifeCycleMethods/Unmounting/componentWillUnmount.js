// If there are any cleanup actions like canceling API calls or clearing any caches in storage you can perform that in the componentWillUnmount method. You cannot use setState inside this method as the component will never be re-rendered.

import React, { Component } from 'react'

export default class ComponentWillUnmount extends Component {
    constructor(props){
        super(props)
            this.state = {
                show: true,
            } 
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <>
              <p>{this.state.show ? <Child/> : null}</p>
               <button onClick={() => {this.setState({show: !this.state.show})}}>Click me to toggle</button>
            </>
        )
    }
}

export class Child extends Component{
    componentWillUnmount(){
        alert('This will unmount')
    }
    render(){
        return(
            <>
            I am a child component
            </>
        )
    }
}

// In the above example, I have created a simple toggle button which will show our Child component if the state is set to true. So after clicking on the button an alert will popup displaying This will unmount The alert will popup because the component is about to be removed from the DOM which in our case is the Child component.
