//constructor():-

// constructor() method is called when the component is initiated and itâ€™s the best place to initialize our state. The constructor method takes props as an argument and starts by calling super(props) before anything else.

import React, { Component } from 'react'

class Constructor extends Component {
    constructor(props){
        super(props)
        this.state={
            massage : "This is constructor method"
        }
    }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.state.massage}
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default Constructor

// Here name is our initial state inside our constructor method and then we are calling our initial state to render method using this.state.name. The following code will output This is a Constructor Method .
