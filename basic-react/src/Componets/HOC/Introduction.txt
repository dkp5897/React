HOC: Higher order component:-

It it a function which takes a component as an arguments and return a new component
HOC is used to share common functionality to different components

const NewComponent = higherOrderComponent(OriginalComponent)
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(OriginalComponent)

const IronMan = WithSuit(TonyStark)

Whereas a component transforms props into UI, a higher-order component transforms a component into another component.
